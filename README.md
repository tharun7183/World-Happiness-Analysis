# World Happiness Data Science Project (Graduate Level)
# World-Happiness-Analysis

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the graduate-level course **DASC 5133 – Intro to Data Science**.
The objective of the project was to analyze the World Happiness dataset and understand the factors
that influence a country's happiness score using statistical analysis and machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
What socio-economic and well-being factors contribute most significantly to a country's overall
happiness score, and how well can these factors be used to predict happiness?

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** World Happiness Dataset
- **Observations:** Country-level data
- **Target Variable:** Happiness Score
- **Key Features:**
  - Economy (GDP per Capita)
  - Family / Social Support
  - Health (Life Expectancy)
  - Freedom
  - Trust (Government Corruption)
  - Generosity

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature relationship analysis
5. Linear Regression modeling
6. Model evaluation and interpretation
7. Prediction using trained models
8. Visualization of results

## Models Used
- **Simple Linear Regression**
  - Analyzed the relationship between individual features and happiness score
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Built a model using multiple predictors to improve prediction accuracy

## Key Insights
- Social support and economic factors show strong positive relationships with happiness score
- Single-feature models provide intuition but have limited predictive power
- Multi-feature regression improves prediction accuracy and explanatory strength
- Model coefficients provide interpretability into feature impact

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The regression models successfully captured meaningful relationships between happiness score
and socio-economic indicators. Visualization of modeled relationships helped validate
assumptions and interpret outcomes.

## What I Learned
- End-to-end data science workflow
- Feature selection and model interpretation
- Practical application of regression techniques
- Importance of data visualization in explaining insights
- Limitations of linear models in real-world data

## Future Improvements
- Apply advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Perform cross-validation
- Feature scaling and regularization
- Time-series analysis across multiple years
